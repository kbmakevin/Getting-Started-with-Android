The purpose of this lab assignment is to:

## Exercise 1
In this exercise you will build a very simple Android application using Android Studio as described here: http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html. 

## Exercise 2
Write an Android application with two activities. The main activity will use several String variables to hold the following information:
-	Your full name
-	Your program name
-	Your semester
-	Course name

Declare the String resources in strings.xml file. Add a button to the main activity. Set its text property to “Display”. No need of using EditText controls in the first activity. Display the above information in a second activity whenever the user clicks on the Display button.

## Exercise 3
Write an Android Application that demonstrates activity life cycle. The main activity should have two button controls to start two other activities, AIActivity and VRActivity. Use a text view control to show the list of life cycle methods that take place when an activity starts. Use two other button controls in the main activity to close AIActivity and VRActivity. Use Toast class methods to display a quick message before activities are finished.
